# Task 2

This folder contains notebooks and code for Task 2.

## Contents

- `task2.ipynb` — Main notebook for Task 2 experiments/analysis.
- `ass1.ipynb`, `visualziation.ipynb` — Additional notebooks (work-in-progress or supporting analysis).

## Environment

Use the same virtual environment as the project root (see top-level README). Ensure the notebook kernel matches that environment.

## Run

1. Activate the environment:
   ```bash
   source ../atml_env/bin/activate
   ```
2. Open `task2.ipynb` and run cells in order.

## Outputs

- Any generated figures/CSVs should be saved into a local `results/` folder (optionally ignored by git). Create it if needed:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p results
  ```

## Notes

- If you need additional packages, install them into the same environment.
- For large artifacts (checkpoints, big CSVs), prefer keeping them out of git or use Git LFS.
